# TITLE
Boozy holiday beverage made with eggs, cream, and alcohol

## Ingredients
- 1 cup cream
- 1 cup additional cream or milk
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup rum
- 1/2 cup whiskey
- (optional, garnish) nutmeg

## Prep
- N/A

## Steps
1. Whip first cup of cream in small bowl
2. Beat eggs in large bowl, then slowly drizzle alcohol until incorporated - don't stop mixing or eggs will curdle.
3. Add sugar, whipped cream, and un-whipped cream/milk to egg and alcohol mixture - whip until smooth
4. Transfer to vessel that allows gas to escape (lid slightly ajar) and chill in refridgerator for 3 weeks.
5. (optional) serve with sprinkle of nutmeg on top

## Notes
- Mixing alcohol directly into the eggs kills the bacteria
- Aging the egg nog for 3 weeks further kills the bacteria and enhances flavor
