# Quick Noodle Stir Fry
A quick, configurable stir fry

## Ingredients
- Rice Noodles
- Onions
- Bell Peppers
- Ginger/Garlic
- Greens
  - Bok Choy
  - Spinach
  - Kale
- Sauce
  - Sesame Oil
  - Rice Vinegar
  - Soy Sauce
  - Fish Sauce
  - Water (for noodle hydration)
- Fresh Herbs
  - Basil
  - Parsley
  - Cilantro

## Prep
- If Rice Noodles are dry, place in water for 1 hour

## Steps
1. On high heat sautee onions and peppers in nuetral oil, adding ginger and garlic later
2. Add in greens to wilt down continuing to sautee on high heat
3. Push mixture to side of pan, add nuetral oil, crack eggs into pan
4. Once eggs are fried, add noodles and sauce. Stir to combine.

## Notes
- Need play around with ratios of sauce components. Most places use low-sodium soy for most of the sauce rounding out with everything else.
- Might be able to add meat somewhere into recipe. Likely need to cook before stir fry and add with greens.
- Substitute rice noodles for either pre-cooked rice or lay on top of fresh rice made in parallel
