- Preheat oven to 350&deg;F
- Line 13x9in pan with foil, with ends extending over sides
- Spray foil with cooking spray

## Steps

1. Microwave chocolate and butter in large microwaveable bowl on high for 2 min or until butter is melted
2. Stir until chocolate is completely melted and mixture is well blended
3. Stir in sugar, eggs, and vanilla
4. Once combined add flour and nuts; mix well
5. Pour into prepared pan
6. Bake 30 to 35 min, or until toothpick inserted into center comes out with fudgy crumbs. Cool completely
