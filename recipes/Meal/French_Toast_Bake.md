# French Toast Bake
French-Toast-like bread pudding with a cinnamon sugar drizzle

## Ingredients
- 1 Loaf Frech or Brioche Bread
- Custard
  - 8 Eggs
  - 3/2 cup of Milk
  - 1/4 cup of Sugar
  - 1 tbsp Vanilla Extract
  - 2 tsp Cinnamon
- Brown Sugar Cinnamon Topping
  - 4 tbsp unsalted butter (melted)
  - 2 tbsp brown sugar
  - 1 tbsp sugar
  - 1 tsp cinnamon
  - 1/8 tsp salt
  - Chopped Walnuts/Pecans (optional)
- Served with syrup or powdered sugar (optional)

## Prep
- Cut bread into 1" cubes and put into bowl
- Combine topping ingredients sans butter and set aside (optional, but since you have everything out already)
- Preheat oven to 375&deg;, will bake for 35-45 min

## Steps
1. Combine custard ingredients into bowl, whisk thoroughly
2. Pour custard over cubed bread, gently folding to avoid destroying bread too much
3. Pour bread and custard mix into baking dish - set mixture aside to chill in fridge for a couple of hours or overnight
4. Once ready to bake, combine brown sugar mixture with melted butter and drizzle on top bread mixture
5. Bake at 375&deg; for 35-45 min
6. Optionally serve with syrup or powdered sugar

## Notes
- Attempted with brioche and it almost turned into a paste, careful with mixing
- Added brown sugar topping after most of bake once, came out just fine
