# Shakshuka with Feta

A classic Middle Eastern and North African dish of eggs baked in a tomato-red pepper sauce spiced with cumin and paprika, topped with feta.

## Ingredients

- 5 oz feta (or blue cheese)
- 6 large eggs
- Vegetables
  - 1 large onion
  - 1 large red bell pepper
  - 3 garlic cloves
  - 1 28 oz can whole plum tomatoes
- Seasonings
  - 1 tsp ground cumin
  - 1 tsp sweet paprika
  - 1/8 tsp ground cayenne
  - salt and pepper
- Toppings (optional)
  - feta or blue cheese
  - cilantro
  - hot sauce

## Prep

- Halve and thinly slice onion.
- Seed and thinly slice red bell pepper.
- Thinly slice garlic cloves.
- Coarsely chop canned tomatoes.
- Crumble feta.
- Chop cilantro.

## Steps

1. Heat oven to 375&deg;F. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low. Add onion and bell pepper. Cook gently until very soft, about 20 minutes.
2. Add garlic and cook until tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cumin, paprika, and cayenne; cook 1 minute.
3. Pour in tomatoes and season with 3/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Simmer until tomatoes have thickened, about 10 minutes. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed.
4. Stir in crumbled feta.
5. Gently crack eggs into skillet over tomatoes. Season eggs with salt and pepper.
6. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until eggs are just set, 7 to 10 minutes. Optionally cover pan for a few minutes until eggs are set.
7. Sprinkle with optional toppings.

## Notes

- Adjust cayenne to taste for desired spice level.
- Ensure skillet is oven-safe if using in oven.
- Feta can be replaced by blue cheese
