# Broccoli Cheddar Soup
Easy to make cheesy and vegetarian soup

## Ingredients
- 1 onion (yellow)
- 1 lb brocolli
- 2 carrots
- 4 Tbsp butter
- 4 Tbsp flour
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups whole milk
- 6 oz (~1 cup) sharp cheddar (shredded)
- Seasoning
  - 1/2 tsp paprika
  - 1/4 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/4 tsp cracked black pepper
  - 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
  - salt (to taste)
- (optional) toasted bread, crackers
 

## Prep
- Dice onions
- Slice carrots, chop broccoli -> can be done as onions saute
- If not already done, shred the cheddar.

## Steps
1. Add butter and onion to pot and saute until onions soft and trasnlucent.
2. Add flour to pot and continue to saute for ~2 mins, or until flour coats bottom of pot and is a light golden brown.
3. Add chicken broth and whisk to dissolve flour. Turn up heat to bring broth to a simmer so that it thickens.
4. Turn heat back down to add milk and seasoning. Bring up to simmer again.
5. Add chopped broccoli and carrots while soup simmers. Stir often over 15 minutes or until carrots tender.
6. Turn heat down to low and add shredded cheese one handful at a time until fully melted. Taste for salt/seasoning.

## Notes
- The butter, flour, broth, and milk ratios almost make a bechamel sauce. 1T:1T:1c. Not sure exactly what to make of that, but it's definitely lighter than a full on bechamel due to half of the liquid being stock/broth.
- First attempt I sauteed the carrots and broccoli before the onions -- end result was good but not sure if it made a difference
- Careful with cayenne and making too spicy -- added sugar to cut back on the spiciness when I made that mistake
- Goes great with some carb as well, bread/crackers
