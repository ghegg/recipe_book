# Chicken and Dumpling Soup
A cozy soup made with chicken and dumplings that cook in the soup

## Ingredients
- Meat
  - 1.5 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- Stock
  - 1 bottle of white wine (optionally 3 cups of water or stock)
  - 4 cups chicken stock
- Vegetables
  - 2 bunches green onion
  - 8 oz white mushrooms
  - 16 oz carrots
  - 12 oz green beans
  - 3-4 garlic cloves
- Thickening Cream
  - 6 egg yolks
  - 3/4 cup of cream
- Seasoning
  - flour
  - 1 lemon
  - oil
  - salt
  - pepper
  - dry herbs
- Dumplings
  - 2 cups cake flour (all purpose works as well)
  - 2 tbsp butter
  - 2 tsp baking powder
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - milk or water
  - fresh herbs: sage, rosemary, thyme, parsley or any combo
  - lemon zest

## Prep
- Meat prep
  - Cut meat to size (it will shrink during cooking)
  - Season generously with herbs, salt, pepper
  - Once seasoned cover in enough flour to coat
- Vegetable prep
  - Chop vegetables into bite sized pieces
- Thickening Cream prep
  - Remove yolks of 6 eggs, saving egg white for other uses
  - Beat yolks into cream
- Dumplings prep
  - Mix flour, melted butter, baking powder, garlic powder, lemon zest, salt, and herbs together
  - Add just enough milk/water (no more than a cup) to get shaggy dough
  - Rool into rough, small balls

## Steps
1. Heat film of oil in large pot. Add prepped meat piece by piece to bottom of pan.
2. When meat brown, push to side of pot and add vegetables that wish to be sauteed (mushrooms - first, green onion white - last)
3. Deglaze with stock and add 2 pinches of salt, galric, and stewed vegetables in intervals (time to cook: carrots 45min, green beans 30min)
4. Cover and Kkeep soup at a low simmer
5. (15 minutes before vegetables cooked) Add dumplings to soup and cover for 10 minutes. Bring soup to a bubble.
6. Turn off heat and add thickening cream, garnishes (green onion tops, herbs), lemon juice, and salt to taste.

## Notes
- Replacement Attempts
  - Thickening cream and wine with 2 cups of stock and a bechamel sauce
  - 1 zucchini for the mushrooms
- Dumplings
  - Be careful not to use work dumplings too much, otherwise they will become dense
  - Cake flour leads to lighter dumplings
- Thickening Cream
  - Make sure soup is no longer bubbling if adding egg based thickening cream.
