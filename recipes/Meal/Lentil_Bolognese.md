# Lentil Bolognese

A hearty vegan pasta sauce with red lentils and walnuts that mimics the texture and depth of traditional meat bolognese.

## Ingredients

- Sauce Base
  - 1 1/2 tbsp Olive oil
  - 1 Large Onion
  - 4 Garlic Cloves
  - 1 tsp Dried Oregano
  - 1 tsp Dried Thyme
  - Salt and Pepper
  - 5.3 oz Tomato Paste
- Lentil Mixture
  - 1 cup Red Lentils
  - 3 cups Vegetable Broth
  - 1/4 cup Walnuts, finely crushed
  - 14.5 oz Crushed Tomatoes
  - 1/2 cup Dry Red Wine (optional)
- Finishing
  - 12-16 oz Pasta (tagliatelle, pappardelle, fettuccine, rigatoni, or penne)
  - 1 tbsp Balsamic Vinegar (or 1-2 tsp sugar)
  - Fresh Parsley or Basil (optional)

## Prep

- Soak red lentils in water for 30-60 minutes
- Dice onion
- Mince garlic
- Finely crush walnuts

## Steps

1. Heat olive oil in a deep saut√© pan over medium-high heat. Add onions with a pinch of salt and cook until golden brown, adding water occasionally to deglaze the pan.
2. Add garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper. Cook for 60-90 seconds, stirring frequently.
3. Stir in tomato paste and cook 2-3 minutes until darker red, stirring very frequently.
4. If using wine, pour into pan to deglaze and cook 1-2 minutes until alcohol smell dissipates.
5. Add broth, stir to combine with tomato paste. Add drained lentils and walnuts, bring to a boil, then reduce to a rapid simmer for 20 minutes.
6. Add crushed tomatoes and simmer another 15-20 minutes until lentils are tender but still al dente.
7. Meanwhile, cook pasta in salted water until al dente. Reserve some pasta water before draining.
8. Taste bolognese for seasoning, add salt and pepper as needed. Finish with balsamic vinegar.
9. Combine hot pasta with bolognese, adding pasta water as needed to coat noodles. Garnish with herbs if using.

## Notes

- Tomato paste from a tube works better than canned for this recipe.
- If you don't have high-quality balsamic vinegar, you can omit it or substitute with 1-2 tsp sugar.
- Store leftover sauce separately from pasta for best results.
- Ensure pasta is egg-free to keep the dish vegan.
