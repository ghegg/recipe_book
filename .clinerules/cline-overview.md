# Project Guidelines

## Task Requirements

- Use the text in /recipes/cline-staging-file.md when asked to create a new recipe
- When creating a new recipe, if the recipe already exists confirm that you should create a new one
- After creating a new recipe using /recipes/cline-staging-file.md remove the recipe text from the file

## Recipe Requirements

- New recipes should be created in the /recipes/ folder
- Create new recipes using the template in /recipes/example.md
- Tags should be reused as much as possible
- Tags should be a list of strings
- Tags should include the meal, category of food, important ingredients, and methods of cooking
- Imperial units should be used for measurements

## Ingredients Requirements

- Ingredients should be grouped under major components of the recipe along with other relevant ingredients
- Ingredients should follow the syntax of "Number Measurement Ingredient". Number and Measurement is optional. Some examples: "8 oz Chicken Thighs", "1 Lemon", "3/4 cup Cream", and "2 tbsp Unsalted Butter"
- Measurements should be lower case and abbreviated. Examples: cups, oz, tsp, tbsp, and lb
- Ingredients should be lower case unless a proper noun

## Steps Requirements

- Steps should focus on the actions and remain concise
- Measurement of temperature should use &deg; after the number and before F for Fahrenheit

## Inspiration Requirements

- If the recipe is taken from the internet it should have a hyperlink to the page it was taken from. Example: [Budget Bytes - Turkey Sriracha Meatballs](https://www.budgetbytes.com/turkey-sriracha-meatballs/)
